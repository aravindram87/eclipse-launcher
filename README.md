##OS X Eclipse Launcher##

This feature will add an **Open Workspace** menu item that will detect the application of the running Eclipse instance and start another in a fashion similar to the **Switch Workspace** command.

Now with all these Eclipse instances up and running it is probably a good idea to be able to tell them apart. The workspace name can be set in **Preferences > General > Workspace** and it will show up in the icon badge. Otherwise the last segment of the workspace path will be used.

Additionaly it is possible to use the **Advanced...** menu item that allowing you to specify launch options when opening a new workspace. Using this you can easily debug a new instance of the running IDE without creating a launch configuration.

Note that OS X 10.6 or newer is required as this feature relies on the [open](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html) command's ability to pass on arguments.

##OS X Quick Look for Eclipse

This feature adds a **Quick Look** command that will activate [OS X Quick Look](http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/#quicklook) on  selected files and folders when **Command+Y** is pressed. Note that the title of the window will state _[DEBUG]_. This is due to the fact that there is no way of starting Quick Look from outside of Finder unless in debug mode.
